<div>The purpose of this site is to give free tutorials (or good reading/guidelines) on Oracle WebCenter Sites. When I started my journey with Oracle WebCenter Sites 11.1.1.8 back in February 2016, there were no concrete tutorial available on internet, all we had was just one developers guide. I agree there were many other blogs having good description but they were all scattered. So with my years of experience I have decided to write my own blogs (basically code snippets) and also integrate great tips & tricks (that I found useful) from other blogs and bring them under one roof.</div>
<br>
<div>I want to stress on this point that I didn't mean to steal or copy the articles from other blogs, I am just aggregating all stuff from differnet nodes under a common tree for educational purposes. The articles that I have refered from are clearly mentioned under "Reference" section.</div>
<br>
<div>Code snippets are shown for demo purpose only, use them in PROD with your understanding and risk.</div>
